# CMSEtech_ClassScraper
Scraper to collect MSU class and course information and save to a spreadsheet. This project was started by [smit1920](https://github.com/smit1920/CMSEtech_ClassScraper) and then updated by [sunxian1217](https://github.com/sunxian1217), both members of the CMSETech Team. 

## Status
This code is working but a little unstable. As of January 1st 2024 the best version was in <Dynamic_Scraper.ipynb>.  

This version requires the installation of the gekodriver.exe file (in windows) to work.  Just put the file in the main git
directory. 

## Next
